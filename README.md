# ML_Progress

This repository tracks my journey in learning and practicing Machine Learning. It is organized into sections for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), modeling experiments, and daily logs. Each folder contains work relevant to different stages of the ML pipeline.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `EDA/` – Exploratory Data Analysis scripts and notebooks.
- `modeling/` – Contains model training experiments and evaluations.
- `daily/` – Day-wise logs and code practice folders.
- `data/` – Raw or processed datasets used in various tasks.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to maintain a clean and structured record of my ML progress. It helps in:

- Organizing experiments and notes
- Practicing concepts daily
- Keeping track of growth over time
- Building a reference base for future projects

## ✅ Usage

- Explore `EDA/` for visualizations and data insights.
- Check `modeling/` for model implementations and training code.
- Look into `daily/` folders for date-wise logs and hands-on exercises.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Mostly uses:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

More tools will be added as I learn them.
